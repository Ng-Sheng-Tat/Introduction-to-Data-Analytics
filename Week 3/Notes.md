## Week 3 Notes

**Process for Identifying data**
1. Determine the information to collect
  - specific information needed
  - possible sources for the data
2. Define a plan for collecting data
  - establish a timeframe
  - volume of data
  - define dependencies and mitigation plan
3. Determine the data collection method
  - sources of data
  - type of data
  - timeframe of your data needed
  - volume of data

**Data Types**
1. Primary Data: Data collected from the source
2. Secondary Data: Information retrieved from existing sources
3. Third-party data: Data refers to the data purchased from aggregators who collect data from various sources and combine it into comprehensive datasets for the purpose of selling the data.

**Data Wrangling or (data munging)** is an iterative process that involves data exploration, transformation, validation, and making it available for a credible and meaningful analysis.

**Data Wrangling Process**
1. Discovery
2. Transformation
  - structuring data (combine and union), normalizing, and denormalizing, cleaning, and enriching data
3. Validation
4. Publishing

Transformation of raw data includes the tasks you undertake to:

1. Structurally manipulate and combine the data using Joins and Unions.

2. **Normalize data**, that is, clean the database of unused and redundant data.

3. **Denormalize data**, that is, combine data from multiple tables into a single table so that it can be queried faster.

4. **Clean data**, which involves profiling data to uncover quality issues, visualizing data to spot outliers, and fixing issues such as missing values, duplicate data, irrelevant data, inconsistent formats, syntax errors, and outliers.

5. **Enrich data**, which involves considering additional data points that could add value to the existing data set and lead to a more meaningful analysis.
