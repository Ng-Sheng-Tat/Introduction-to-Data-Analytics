### Week 4 Notes
**Statistics** is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of numerical or quantitative data.

**Statistical Analysis** is the application of statistical methods to a sample of data in order to develop an understanding of what that data represents.

Statistical Methods help to ensure that *data is interpreted correctly*, and *apparent relationships are meaningful*.

**Data Mining** is the process of extracting knowledge from data, and it aims to identify correlations in data, find patterns and variations, understanding trends, and predict probabilities

**Data Mining Techniques**
1. Descriptive
2. Diagnostic
3. Predictive
4. Prescriptive Modelling
5. *Classification*: classifying attributes into target categories
6. *Clustering*: involve grouping data into clusters so they can be treated as groups
7. *Anomaly or Outlier Detection*: Finding patterns in data that are not normal or expected
8. *Association Rule Mining*: Establishing a relationship between two data events
9. *Sequential Patterns*: Tracing a series of events that take place in a sequence
10. *Affinity Grouping*: Discovering co-occurrence in relationships
11. *Decision Trees*: Building classification models in the form of a tree structure with multiple branches, where each branch represents a probable occurrence.
12. *Regression*: Identifying the nature of the relationship between two variables, which could be casual or correlational

**Data Mining Tools**: R-language, IBM SPSS Statistics, Python, IBM Watson Studio, Excel-Spreadsheet, SAS

**Story-telling** is important for a data scientist.

**Data Visualization** is the discipline of communicating information through the use of visual elements such as graphs, charts, and maps. Its goal is to make information easy to comprehend, interpret, and retain.

**Data Visualization** tools include Spreadsheet, Google Sheets, Jupyter Notebook, Python (Matlplotlib, Bokeh, Seaborn, ggplot, plotly), R-studio (R-Shiny), IBM Cognos Analysics, Tableau, Power BI
